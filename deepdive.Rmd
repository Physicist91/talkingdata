## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
phone_brand_device_model <- read.csv("raw_data/phone_brand_device_model.csv", colClasses=c(rep("factor", 3)))

gender_age_train <- read.csv("raw_data/gender_age_train.csv", colClasses = c("factor", "factor", "integer", "factor"))

phone_info <- merge(gender_age_train, phone_brand_device_model, by="device_id")

phone_info$phone_brand_device_model <- paste(phone_info$phone_brand, phone_info$device_model)

phone_stats <- phone_info %>%
  group_by(phone_brand_device_model) %>%
  summarise(mean_age=mean(age, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_age=median(age, na.rm=TRUE),
            male_count=sum(gender == "M"),
            female_count=sum(gender=="F"))

phone_stats %>% arrange(desc(abs(mean_age - median_age))) %>% head(20)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(phone_stats, aes(x=mean_age, y=median_age, col=phone_brand_device_model)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
